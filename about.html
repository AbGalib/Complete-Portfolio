            <h2>My Self</h2>
            <p class="gap">My name is Ghalib Abdullah Noor. Since childhood I had a lot of interest in computers and
                technology. So from childhood I thought that I would grow up to be a computer engineer one day.
                My father is a government employee and as a result
                I have traveled to different parts of Bangladesh and
                received education from different schools. My village
                home is Manikganj. I studied in Manikganj Government
                High School from class five to class ten and passed SSC
                from there with GPA five. Later I moved to Dhaka and got
                admission in Udayan Higher Secondary School and College
                and completed HSC from there with 4.33 result.
                I thought that Daffodil International University
                would be the right choice for me. So without thinking
                anything else I got admission here and till now
                studying here, I am doing B.Sc in CSE here with 3.75
                CGPA.</p>

                am aware of various frameworks like bootstrap, tailwind etc. I am now determined to strengthen my web
                development skills by learning javascript. I want to give my best to create a good position in this
